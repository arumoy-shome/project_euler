# Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a series of mathematical and computer science problems.

Here you can find solutions to some of those problems. I use ruby and treat each
problem as a code kata, applying a strict TDD process whilst striving for an
elegant solution and implementation.
